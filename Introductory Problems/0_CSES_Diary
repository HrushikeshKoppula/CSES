>Weird Algorithm
i used int for n and it didnt take some input cause it wouldn't fit in int and for some inputs it wasn't fitting after multiplying with 3, can you believe it? like they clearly said int in question...
>Missing Number
at first i thought of using long long as usual, but it was not needed as in the previous problem the int or sum can reach but in this problem it wasn't and it would make it faster too cause i wanted to use sort, lets think can i do in a better way?
maybe subtract the sum from normal needed sum?? then ll again lol
that method didn't work as sum was getting bigger than long long lol, or was the int getting big?? Damn that was the case i guess i must try my best to use long long everywhere, i observed that they have wonderful servers (or i have a really bad pc) cause when i submitted the code it said that it was correct in less than a second for even 2,00,000 testcase while mine gave up at 50,000...
>Repetitions
for some reason my outputs were empty maybe something wrong with my while(cin >> x) loop, well i guess i must use stringstring, why does this make me feel bad now...
DAMNNNNNNNN, i forgot to return the value(i mean cout) and was worried that i wasn't getting any output LOL, i got answer-1 as answer, yea that's my code alright(Damn my Ego/)
>Increasing Array
i got it not first try yet but i got it...
DEBUGGING in VSCode is really OP.
>Permutations
Damn no idea bro, lets take our time to think...
I just kept odd and even bits beside so abs diff is always two, i tried to write elegant code so it took some time but they fooled me with 1... here i was thinking i was finally gonna get first try and for such a problem
>Number Spiral
it took me hours to get the idea and few more hours to code mostly cause there was class but i did a lot of other things instead of coding this problem, well those were productive too so np i guess.
Finally 1st try but it only had two testcases...
>Two Knights
got bottom up idea but hard to code as calculations needed...
I am feeling really bad cause i just saw the solution, well he did it wonderfully. Damn it..., here's the link by the way:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3266257/number-of-ways-two-knights-can-be-placed-such-that-they-dont-attack
>Two Sets
Damn i had to see solution again, have i already reached my limit??
https://github.com/Jonathan-Uy/CSES-Solutions/blob/main/Introductory%20Problems/Two%20Sets%20I.cpp
i saw the solution and then coded on my own, so i guess its ok.
>Bit Strings
easy??
damn yet it became wrong...
i am really amazed at how fast the computers at cses are...
damsel in distress...
lol  that book has really helped no wonder its the top recomendation.
welll i still didnt solve the problem so lets not get ahead of ourselves
it worked yea..
but its scary how the problems exact solution was there in the book
>Trailing Zeros
i wanna cry.....
my first 1st try accepted...
lets not get cocky
i thank my parents , the gods, the writer of book.pdf , cses website creators . i.e creators of me , the sum, the solution , the world ...
>Coin Piles
damn i was +ve i would have rocked it but they are crazy damn it...
runtime error was wonderful;
damn it got accepted
damn i understood my 2nd mistake too cause of it ...
b/a<=2 and b<=2*a has so much difference damn it;
>Palindrome Reorder
Damon, i took some time and did it it was hard to even achieve at this solution yet everything was red when i submitted, 
DAMMMMM, i didnt read question correctly , i kept "YES" even when they didnt ask me ...
DDDDAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMM, they asked "NO SOLUTION" i gave them a simple "NO", twice already...
finally , a proper error , time limit exceeded.
last edited 26th april, todays 15th may, long gap cause of exams.
i finally got a better solution, after reading a few solutions , it was neither theirs nor mine .
>>I understood at that time that watching solutions is not bad and that i should do it more often.
now my solution runs in O(n/2) except the string concantation that is wasting time 
wring solutuin damn it'
after debugging i got my mistake, i was forgetting about z...
lets optimise that concatinantion part too.
DAMN ACCEPTED AND IT TOOK REALLY LOW TIMES ALL ARE UNDER 0.1s.
updating vscode...
